Description: ESDKeys can be used to gather ecological site information from the EDIT database 
(https://edit.jornada.nmsu.edu/) and format it into a quantitative key, and to assess 
monitoring data against ecological site criteria to understand probable ecological site 
matches for monitoring plots based on ecological site criteria and plot data. This tool 
should not be used as a substitute for the field identification of ecological sites. 
However, it can be used if no ecological sites were assigned at the time of field data 
collection (e.g., due to lack of ecological sites) with additional validation 
(e.g., reviewing plot soil pits and photos). It can be used as a quality control step to 
understand where and why there might not be strong matches between quantitative monitoring 
data and ecological site descriptions. ESDKeys produces tables of ecological site criteria 
for an Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) with an option to limit the output to a geographic 
state of interest (e.g., all ecological sites from MLRA 36 in the state of NM). 
ESDKeys can read in monitoring plot data out of TerrADat database or the Landscape Data 
Commons for an MLRA or state, and tabulate the data into a standardized format to be 
compared against ecological site key tables. The monitoring plots are compared against 
every possible ecological site, and assigned a best match based on highest proportion of 
criteria met.

\title{Key Monitoring Plots to Ecological Sites
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{Pull and tabulate monitoring plot data from a TerrADat database, and assign plots to ecological sites based on proportion of ecological site criteria met. Monitoring plots can be subset by a user-defined polygon (e.g., MLRA or administrative boundary) or by geographic state. To download a geodatabase of MLRAs to use, visit https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/resources/data-and-reports/major-land-resource-area-mlra. There is an option to assign weight scalars in three classes to ecological site criteria, using weight = TRUE, with weight class one being least important and weight class three being most important. If weights = TRUE, ecological site criteria that aren't assigned a weight class will default to weight class one. KeyPlots() relies on the availability of an ecological site key generated by KeyBuild().
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~

\usage{
KeyPlots(
  source.dsn = NULL
  mlra = NULL
  keypolyset = FALSE,
  keystateset = TRUE,
  weights = FALSE
)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{source.dsn}{Character string. The filepath and filename to a TerrADat geodatabase
}
  \item{sitekey}{Character string. The name of the ecological site key in the environment created by KeyBuild(). If KeyBuild() has just been named, this will be SiteKey.
}
  \item{keypolyset}{True/False. If FALSE, monitoring data will be subset by state only.
}
  \item{keystateset}{True/False. If TRUE, monitoring data will be subset by state. If FALSE, a polygon must be provided to subset monitoring data.
}
  \item{weights}{True/False. If FALSE, all criteria are weighted equally. If TRUE, weight scalars will be used when considering proportion of criteria met and criteria must be assigned to weight classes one, two, and three.
}

%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
Two outputs are produced: 1) a .csv of monitoring plots, the ecological site for which each plot matched the most criteria, and the proportion of criteria met; and 2) a dataframe of monitoring plots, the ecological site to which each plot matched the most criteria, and all criteria with plot values and relational statements.
